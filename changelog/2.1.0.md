# Version 2.1.0 - Information Systems
## Version notes

The main purpose of this minor release is to generate a new reference build for a reproducibility paper submitted to [Information Systems](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/information-systems).

Some major changes include:

-   **Judge mapping*: the judges name are not just parsed but cleaned and mapped using the official list of judges provided by the European Court of Human Rights. This makes the network analysis of judges votes more reliable.
-   **Tables**: Tables in judgements were ignored by the parser. They are now attached to the judgement in dedicated field.
-   **Deployment, CD/CI, code quality**: We focused on producing better code, fully end-to-end and with a fully automated deployment. The build is now automatically generated and updated every month.
-   **Reproducilibity**: It is now possible to input a list of cases to be certain to reproduce perfectly a build.
